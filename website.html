			A  heart attack, also called a <b>myocardial infarction</b>, happens when a part of the heart muscle doesn't get enough blood. The more time that passes without treatment to restore blood flow, the greater the damage to the heart muscle.  The lack of blood flow can occur because of many different factors but is usually related to a blockage in one or more of your heart’s arteries. Without blood flow, the affected heart muscle will begin to die. If blood flow isn’t restored quickly, a heart attack can cause permanent heart damage and death. A heart attack is a life-threatening emergency. If you suspect you or someone you’re with is having a heart attack, call 911 (or your local emergency services phone number). Time is critical in treating a heart attack, and a delay of even a few minutes can result in permanent heart damage or death. But don't worry as you delve into this website you will able to gain knowledge and learn basic first aid response and life saving tips  while waiting for your emergency providers.

			As a first step, let us learn the <b><i>DANGER SIGNS</i></b>
	</p>

	<p align="left">
				-<b>Chest Pain</b> or(angina). This can be mild and feel like discomfort or heaviness, or it can be severe and feel like crushing pain. It may start in your chest and spread (or radiate) to other areas like your left arm (or both arms), shoulder, neck, jaw, back or down toward your waist.
	</p>
	<p align="left">
				-<b>Shortness of Breath</b> or trouble in breathing.
	</p>
	<p align="left">
				-<b>Fatigue</b> or tiredness
	</p>
	<p align="left">
				-<b>Nausea</b> or stomach discomfort. Heart attacks can often be mistaken for indigestion or heartburn.
	</p>
	<p align="left">		
				-<b>Anxiety</b> or a feeling of “impending doom" and sweating.
	</p>
	<p align="left">
				-<b>Lightheadedness</b> dizzy or passing out.
	</p>
	
	
	<p align="left">
				<em><b>WHAT TO DO?</b></em>
	</p>
	<p align="left">
				This are some of the things you can do as per initial symptoms confirmed as per assessment to someone suffering cardiac arrest.
	</p>
	<p align="left">
				<b>Loosen any tight clothing and assist the patientn in a comfortable position.</b> This is to promot5e proper circulation and facilitate breathing.
	</p>
	<p align="left">	
				<b>Chew and swallow an aspirin while waiting for emergency help.</b> Aspirin helps keep your blood from clotting. When taken during a heart attack, it could reduce heart damage. Don't take aspirin if you are allergic to it or have been told by your health care provider never to take aspirin.
	</p>
	<p align="left">
				<b>Take nitroglycerin, if prescribed.</b> If you think you're having a heart attack and your health care provider has previously prescribed nitroglycerin for you, take it as directed while waiting for emergency medical help.
	</p>
	<p align="left">
				<b>Begin CPR if the person is unconscious.</b> If the person isn't breathing or you don't find a pulse, begin CPR to keep blood flowing after you call for emergency medical help. Push hard and fast on the center of the person's chest in a fairly rapid rhythm — about 100 to 120 compressions a minute.
	</p>			
	<p align="left">
				<b>If an automated external defibrillator (AED)</b> is immediately available and the person is unconscious, follow the device instructions for using it.

	<center><b> HOW COULD I PREVENT HEART ATTACK?</b></center>
	
	<p>There are several ways you can reduce your risk of developing heart attack</p>
<p>	
	<b>Eat a healthy, balanced diet</b>
A low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended, which should include plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (5 portions a day) and whole grains. You should limit the amount of salt you eat to no more than 6g (0.2oz) a day as too much salt will increase your blood pressure. 6g of salt is about 1 teaspoonful. There are 2 types of fat: saturated and unsaturated. You should avoid food containing saturated fats, because these will increase the levels of bad cholesterol in your blood.

<p>
	<b>Be more physically active</b>Combining a healthy diet with regular exercise is the best way of maintaining a healthy weight. Having a healthy weight reduces your chances of developing high blood pressure. Regular exercise will make your heart and blood circulatory system more efficient, lower your cholesterol level, and also keep your blood pressure at a healthy level. Any aerobic exercise, such as walking, swimming and dancing, makes your heart work harder and keeps it healthy.

	<p>
	<b>Keep to a healthy weight</b> A GP or practice nurse can tell you what your ideal weight is in relation to your height and build. Alternatively, find out what your body mass index (BMI)
</p>

<p>
<b>	Give up smoking</b> If you smoke, giving up will reduce your risk of developing heart attack. Smoking is a major risk factor for developing atherosclerosis (furring of the arteries). It also causes the majority of cases of coronary thrombosis in people under the age of 50.
</p>

<p>
<b>Reduce your alcohol consumption</b>If you drink, do not exceed the maximum recommended limits. Men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week. Spread your drinking over 3 days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week. Always avoid binge drinking, as this increases the risk of a heart attack.
</p>

<p><b>Keep your blood pressure under control.</b>You can keep your blood pressure under control by eating a healthy diet low in saturated fat, exercising regularly and, if needed, taking medicine to lower your blood pressure. Your target blood pressure should be below 140/90mmHg.
</p>

<p><b>Keep your diabetes under control</b>You have a greater chance of developing CHD if you have diabetes. Being physically active and controlling your weight and blood pressure will help manage your blood sugar level.If you have diabetes, your target blood pressure level should be below 130/80mmHg.
</p>

<p><b>Take any prescribed medicine</b>If you have CHD, you may be prescribed medicine to help relieve your symptoms and stop further problems developing.If you do not have CHD but have high cholesterol, high blood pressure or a history of family heart disease, your doctor may prescribe medicine to prevent you developing heart-related problems.
